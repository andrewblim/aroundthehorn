Around the Horn
===============

v0.1

About
-----

Around the Horn is a Chrome add-in that pulls in all play-by-play data from MLB into a single page feed. If you like seeing all of the ongoing games at once, like an RSS or Twitter feed, rather than switching back and forth with MLB.com's Gameday or on sites like ESPN or Yahoo! Sports, this is for you. 

Installation
------------

To install, open the file aroundthehorn.crx with Chrome. 

When you install Around the Horn, Chrome will ask you if you want to allow the extension to see "your" data on gd2.mlb.com. This is MLB's server where game events are posted in XML format, so you will need to grant permissions for Around the Horn to function properly. I don't expect that you would have any personal data on this server except possibly if you work for MLB, and even then, I wouldn't expect it. 

Miscellany
----------

I wrote Around the Horn as a small project to teach myself jQuery and to give myself a refresher on HTML and CSS. When starting out, it was the first thing I'd programmed in a while outside of small scripts and some spreadsheet macros at the office. I don't anticipate supporting this project closely, probably only returning to it from time to time when the mood takes me. However, I'm still happy to take any input; see contact info at the bottom of this file.

This add-in is made possible by MLB.com's wonderful decision to make game event-related XML files publicly available. I adhered to MLB's copyright notice in creating this project, which is why this a browser add-in and not a website, a publishable RSS feed, a Twitter account, etc. As it depends on MLB's data it is somewhat at MLB's mercy; for example, a format change or file naming convention change could break this add-in.
