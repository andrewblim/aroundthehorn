		<h3>Usage</h3>
		
		<p class="help">
			Around the Horn is a Chrome add-in that pulls in all play-by-play data from MLB into a single page feed. If you like seeing all of the ongoing games at once, like an RSS or Twitter feed, rather than switching back and forth with MLB.com's Gameday or on sites like ESPN or Yahoo! Sports, this is for you. I suggest setting the auto-refresh to some reasonable interval and pinning the add-in's tab (right-click its title and select "Pin Tab") so you can easily refer back to it periodically as you do other stuff. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="help">
			The add-in consists of three pages: the event feed, the settings page, and the help page. The event feed is the main page you will be looking at. Enter the date for which you want to see game events in the box labeled "As of date". The add-in will then populate the scoreboard for that date and also pull in that day's events. You can click games in the scoreboard to show or hide its game events below. When you hover over a game event, two arrow icons appear to its left. Click the arrow pointing to the right to highlight only that game's events. Click the arrow pointing to the left to restore the default game selections (which can be configured on the settings page). 
		</p>
		
		<p class="help">
			The settings page allows you to control the auto-refresh interval, which teams' games are selected by default, and how many hours before or after midnight you would like to elapse before the default as-of date rolls to the next day. Detailed explanations are on that page. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="help">
			The help page is, of course, what you are reading.

		<h3>About</h3>
		
		<p class="help">
			I wrote Around the Horn as a small project to teach myself jQuery and to give myself a refresher on HTML and CSS. When starting out, it was the first thing I'd programmed in a while outside of small scripts and some spreadsheet macros at the office. I don't anticipate supporting this project closely, probably only returning to it from time to time when the mood takes me. However, I'm still happy to take any input; you can contact me at andrew [dot] b [dot] lim at gmail [dot] com. 
		</p>
		
		<p class="help">
			This add-in is made possible by MLB.com's wonderful decision to make game event-related XML files publicly available. (<a href="http://gd2.mlb.com/components/">This</a> is the main site, although everything I used came from <a href="http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/">this</a> subdirectory.) I adhered to MLB's <a href="http://gdx.mlb.com/components/copyright.txt">copyright notice</a> in this project, which is why this a browser add-in and not a website, a publishable RSS feed, a Twitter account, etc. As it depends on MLB's data it is somewhat at MLB's mercy; for example, a format change or file naming convention change could break this add-in.
